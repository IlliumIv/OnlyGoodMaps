# OnlyGoodMaps

Warns user about bad map layouts. Map base is updated to 3.9 poe patch (65 very good + 28 good + 41 cancer + 19 unqiue = 153/153 maps covered)

S/A tier map - Green border. Kill boss

B- tier map - Red border and sound. Skip boss

Unknown t14+ map - Yellow border. Usually means plugin is outdated

## How is it better ?

1. Because there's huge disparity between maps. If you had to quantify it, Good/desired maps are worth several 'bad' maps.
2. Map drop rates are fixed. Upgrade chance doesn't change this, only the final tier

This removes maps from the pool which are undesirable and/or just dead drops. So yes, you're going to get fewer tier upgrade maps, so overall the average tier of maps being dropped (across many hundreds) is lower. However, the overall maps being drop are of much higher value. So in the end, its absolutely worth it. This was the entire premise of shaped strats, and why they work and people liked/used them. 

The way this plays out in practice is something like this for some of X maps run over Y hours (numbers exaggerated and simplified):

1. No strat (all maps): 
 - 100 maps drop in X maps run over Y hours, 
 - 10 tier 'Z' maps drop, 
 - but most of those are shit maps, only 2 maps are worth running. The rest rot in your stash and/or you're forced to run them when you run out of good/desired maps and just hope to get better map drops.
2. Some strat (subset of premium maps completed): 
  - 200 maps drop in X maps run over Y/2 hours.
  - 12 tier 'Z' maps drop, 
  - but most/all of those are good/desired maps, so 12 maps are worth running. 
  - Not only do you spend less time generating more maps, but you're spend most/all your time running only the good/desired maps, and probably even have excess good maps to sell off, which players want because they are good maps.

Clearly, 2 is a just better and always has been when it comes to pure mapping. The only difference now is you can permanently brick your atlas, requiring a new account, instead of just spending a few chaos to uncomplete a map.
